# PrismaticWarning

This AddOn has been abandoned due to ZOS changing the way Prismatic Enchants work. With the changes, AddOn no longer has any purpose. The project is kept for archival purposes only, and in the very rare chance that ZOS brings back the old functionality of prismatic enchants.

Prismatic Warning alerts when to slot a weapon with a prismatic onslaught enchant (henceforth called a “prismatic weapon”) in dungeons, trials, and arenas.
